# MemeCrawler Project

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Meme Report System** is a full-stack application that automatically collects the **top memes from Reddit (/r/memes) in the last 24 hours**, stores and serves them via a **.NET 8 Web API**, displays them in a **React/Next.js frontend**, and delivers a **daily PDF report to Telegram** using **n8n automation**.

This project was designed and developed as a **technical assignment** (showcasing backend, frontend, and workflow automation).

Key highlights:

---

- **Backend**: ASP.NET 8 Web API with Reddit OAuth integration.
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js UI to browse and trigger reports.
- **Automation**: n8n cron workflow that generates & sends Telegram reports.
- **Deployment**: Runs locally with Docker Compose or on AWS (EC2, ECS, Amplify).

---

## Project Objectives

1. Create a webservice that crawls https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/ and returns top 20 voted posts for the past 24 hours. Sorted by top voted post first, descending order.

2. Stores the crawled data into a database for historical tracking and future data visualization.

3. Present and generate a report file for past 24 hrs top 20 trending memes that can be sent as a file via a Telegram Chatbot.

4. Create a presentation deck to showcase live demo and explain both frontend and backend designs.

5. Suggest 3 alternative use cases or actionable insights from the generated report.

ü§ñ How We Fetch Top 20 Memes (Past 24h)

üîó API Endpoint Used

```bash
https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/top/.json?t=day&limit=20
```

- /r/memes ‚Üí the subreddit we‚Äôre tracking

- /top ‚Üí fetches posts sorted by upvotes

- .json ‚Üí requests a JSON response instead of HTML

- t=day ‚Üí restricts results to posts from the past 24 hours

- limit=20 ‚Üí fetch only the top 20 posts

üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Headers

For production usage, I integrated with Reddit‚Äôs OAuth2 API at:

```bash
https://oauth.reddit.com/r/memes/top?t=day&limit=20
```

This requires:

- Client ID + Client Secret from a Reddit ‚ÄúScript App‚Äù

- Username + Password (for server-side password grant)

- A proper User-Agent string (Reddit requires this)

e.g.:

```bash
MemeCrawler/1.0 (by u:Ademi47)
```

üì• Example JSON Response (trimmed)

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "children": [
      {
        "data": {
          "id": "abc123",
          "title": "Did you know my Internet name is Ademi47",
          "url": "https://i.redd.it/ademi.png",
          "ups": 6743,
          "created_utc": 1725021123,
          "permalink": "/r/memes/comments/abc123/Did_you_know_my_Internet_name_is_Ademi47/"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

üóÑÔ∏è What I Store

**From each Reddit post, I extract and persist:**

- id ‚Üí stable Reddit post ID (used as unique key in DB)

- title ‚Üí post title

- url ‚Üí direct media or link

- ups ‚Üí upvote count

- created_utc ‚Üí original Reddit timestamp

- permalink ‚Üí Reddit link to the post

**This data is written into:**

- memes ‚Üí canonical table (latest state of each post)

- memesnapshots ‚Üí time-stamped snapshot (who was top at each 10-minute run)

## üõ†Ô∏è MemeCrawler Service (Back end)

A lightweight background job _MemeCrawlWorker_ runs on a schedule (e.g., every 20 minutes) and performs these steps:

- Fetch Top Posts (24h window)

- Calls Reddit API for /r/memes top posts (t=day, limit=20).

- Normalizes each record (title, media URL, upvotes, created_utc, author, permalink, etc.).

- De-duplication & Idempotency

- Computes a stable external key per post (e.g., reddit_post_id from Reddit‚Äôs id).

- Checks if that reddit_post_id already exists then insert snapshot accordingly.

- New post ‚Üí insert.

- Existing post ‚Üí upsert only fields that can change (e.g., upvotes, thumbnail, removed flag).

## üìî GEN AI Prompts and Usage

Below are some of the key GEN-AI prompts that I used in this project.

**1. Frontend with Next.js + Tailwind + Troubleshooting**

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a frontend with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Show me how to structure a Reports page that fetches from my API and displays data in cards. Include a Send Report button that calls a POST endpoint. Make it responsive.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a CORS error in my Next.js frontend when calling my backend API. Explain why this happens and how to fix it (server-side CORS policy vs client-side fetch).‚Äù

- ‚ÄúMy Tailwind buttons look greyed out. Show me how to style them with hover, active, and focus states so they look clickable.‚Äù

**2. Reddit API & Auth Token Retrieval**

- ‚ÄúExplain step-by-step how to create a Reddit script app, get a client ID and secret, and use them to generate an OAuth2 access token with the password grant type. Show example curl commands.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhy am I getting invalid_grant when requesting a Reddit access token? Walk me through the common causes and fixes.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow can I safely store Reddit API credentials (client id, secret, username, password) in environment variables for my .NET backend?‚Äù

**3. LINQ Queries & Code Optimization**

- "I have a list of memes with fields (Title, Upvotes, CreatedAt). Show me a LINQ query in C# to get the top 20 memes from the last 24 hours ordered by Upvotes.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúExplain how to optimize EF Core LINQ queries so they don‚Äôt fetch unnecessary data. Show examples of Select, AsNoTracking, and filtering before projecting.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to profile slow LINQ queries in .NET and rewrite them for performance?‚Äù

**4. Why I Picked n8n for Automation**

- ‚ÄúI want to automatically fetch data from my API every hour, generate a PDF, and send it to Telegram. What workflow automation tool should I use? Compare Zapier, Airflow, and n8n.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúShow me how to build an n8n workflow with Cron ‚Üí HTTP Request ‚Üí HTML to PDF ‚Üí Telegram Bot. Include JSON structure for the workflow.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow can I test my local API with a remote n8n instance? Explain tunneling options (ngrok, localtunnel) and how to configure n8n HTTP nodes.‚Äù

## üîç Live Demo‚Äù

### Video Guide

Please Click below link to watch the project Demo.

```

**Note:**

```bash
This video is unlisted hence it's not searchable. Kindly do not share the link.
The project has been successfully deployed to the production environment for functionality testing.
However, I encountered some CORS issues on the frontend, which are preventing it from running fully at the moment.
I‚Äôm actively working on resolving these and will have the frontend up and running as soon as possible.
```

### Production Test using API calls via Browser (or Postman)

**Memes Route**

```bash
1. Open: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/memes/top-24h, Alteratively you may go to -> https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/swagger/index.html. then trigger the API via swagger.

Note: You‚Äôll see a JSON array of meme posts.

Sample:

{
"id":"1n3fwwb",
"title":"Monster.com",
"author":"Own_Touch9354",
"permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/1n3fwwb/monstercom/",
"contentUrl":"https://i.redd.it/wuaox6tb90mf1.jpeg",
"upvotes":19788,"numComments":72,
"createdUtc":"2025-08-29T18:53:35+00:00",
"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/13uoRnFJFR9ASqdkVBIX67PpI4ycBv8-t_HB3tcpyEg.jpg"
}

3. In the UI, when /memes route refreshes, this calls the above API and shows the Memes posts list (with images, vote counts and post links).

4. There are two views in the UI. /memes and /reports
```

**Reports Route**

```bash
1. Open: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/reports/top-24h, Alteratively you may go to -> https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/swagger/index.html. then trigger the API via swagger.

2. Click Send Report on the Reports page.

3. The UI fires: POST /reports/send-telegram-now.

4. The API fetches current top-24h posts and formats a summary (or builds PDF).

5. Telegram Bot sends the message/document into your configured chat.

6. You see a success toast in the UI (and the new report in PDF format in Telegram).
```
