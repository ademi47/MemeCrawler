# MemeCrawler Project

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Meme Report System** is a full-stack application that automatically collects the **top memes from Reddit (/r/memes) in the last 24 hours**, stores and serves them via a **.NET 8 Web API**, displays them in a **React/Next.js frontend**, and delivers a **daily PDF report to Telegram** using **n8n automation**.

This project was designed and developed as a **technical assignment** (showcasing backend, frontend, and workflow automation).

Key highlights:

---

- **Backend**: ASP.NET 8 Web API with Reddit OAuth integration.
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js UI to browse and trigger reports.
- **Automation**: n8n cron workflow that generates & sends Telegram reports.
- **Deployment**: Runs locally with Docker Compose or on AWS (EC2, ECS, Amplify).

---

## Project Objectives

1. Create a webservice that crawls https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/ and returns top 20 voted posts for the past 24 hours. Sorted by top voted post first, descending order.

2. Stores the crawled data into a database for historical tracking and future data visualization.

3. Present and generate a report file for past 24 hrs top 20 trending memes that can be sent as a file via a Telegram Chatbot.

4. Create a presentation deck to showcase live demo and explain both frontend and backend designs.

5. Suggest 3 alternative use cases or actionable insights from the generated report.

_Error Responses_

```bash
400 Bad Request — Invalid take (e.g., negative or non-numeric).

{ "error": "Invalid 'take' value. Must be a positive integer." }
```

```bash
429 Too Many Requests — Upstream Reddit rate-limited and local retries exhausted.

{ "error": "Rate limited. Please retry shortly." }
```

```bash

_Notes_

- Sorting is descending by upvotes.

- Data is retrieved live from Reddit (or our cache layer, if added).

- server-side caching can be added (e.g., 60–120s) to reduce API churn.

**_2) Trigger Telegram Report and send to Telegram Bot_**

This process the current top-24h report and send it to the configured Telegram chat. This is used by the UI button and/or n8n.

Endpoint

```bash
POST /reports/send-telegram-now
```

Request Body

```bash
No body required.
```

Example Requests

```bash
# cURL
curl -X POST https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/reports/send-telegram-now

# HTTP
http POST https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/reports/send-telegram-now
```

_Success Response — 200 OK_

```bash
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Report sent to Telegram."
}
```

_Error Responses_

```bash
{
503 Service Unavailable — Telegram disabled or not configured.

{
  "error": "Telegram disabled: BotToken/ChatId not configured."
}
```

```bash
502 Bad Gateway — Telegram API failure (non-2xx from Bot API).

{ "error": "Telegram send failed." }
```

```bash
500 Internal Server Error — Any unexpected server-side exception.

{ "error": "Unexpected server error." }
```

_Notes_

This endpoint does not return the PDF; it triggers delivery to Telegram.

For automation, this can be called from n8n on a Cron schedule or a manual “Execute Workflow”.

## 🛠️ How the Background Service Stores Data in Database

A lightweight background job _MemeCrawlWorker_ runs on a schedule (e.g., every 20 minutes) and performs these steps:

- Fetch Top Posts (24h window)

- Calls Reddit API for /r/memes top posts (t=day, limit=20).

- Normalizes each record (title, media URL, upvotes, created_utc, author, permalink, etc.).

- De-duplication & Idempotency

- Computes a stable external key per post (e.g., reddit_post_id from Reddit’s id).

- Checks if that reddit_post_id already exists then insert snapshot accordingly.

- New post → insert.

- Existing post → upsert only fields that can change (e.g., upvotes, thumbnail, removed flag).

## 🔍 Live Demo — What You’ll See When “Clicking API”

**A) In the Browser (or Postman)**

```bash
1. Open: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/reports/top-24h, Alteratively you may go to -> https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/swagger/index.html. then trigger the API via swagger.

2. You’ll see a JSON array of meme posts (title, url, upvotes, createdAt).

3. In the UI, this populates the Reports page list (with images and vote counts).
```

B) “Send Report” Button

```bash
1. Click Send Report on the Reports page.

2. The UI fires: POST /reports/send-telegram-now.

3. The API fetches current top-24h posts and formats a summary (or builds PDF).

4. Telegram Bot sends the message/document into your configured chat.

5. You see a success toast in the UI (and the new report in PDF format in Telegram).
