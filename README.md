# MemeCrawler Project

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Meme Report System** is a full-stack application that automatically collects the **top memes from Reddit (/r/memes) in the last 24 hours**, stores and serves them via a **.NET 8 Web API**, displays them in a **React/Next.js frontend**, and delivers a **daily PDF report to Telegram** using **n8n automation**.

This project was designed and developed as a **technical assignment** (showcasing backend, frontend, and workflow automation).

Key highlights:

---

- **Backend**: ASP.NET 8 Web API with Reddit OAuth integration.
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js UI to browse and trigger reports.
- **Automation**: n8n cron workflow that generates & sends Telegram reports.
- **Deployment**: Runs locally with Docker Compose or on AWS (EC2, ECS, Amplify).

---

## Project Objectives

1. Create a webservice that crawls https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/ and returns top 20 voted posts for the past 24 hours. Sorted by top voted post first, descending order.

2. Stores the crawled data into a database for historical tracking and future data visualization.

3. Present and generate a report file for past 24 hrs top 20 trending memes that can be sent as a file via a Telegram Chatbot.

4. Create a presentation deck to showcase live demo and explain both frontend and backend designs.

5. Suggest 3 alternative use cases or actionable insights from the generated report.

ü§ñ How We Fetch Top 20 Memes (Past 24h)

üîó API Endpoint Used

```bash
https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/top/.json?t=day&limit=20
```

- /r/memes ‚Üí the subreddit we‚Äôre tracking

- /top ‚Üí fetches posts sorted by upvotes

- .json ‚Üí requests a JSON response instead of HTML

- t=day ‚Üí restricts results to posts from the past 24 hours

- limit=20 ‚Üí fetch only the top 20 posts

üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Headers

For production usage, I integrated with Reddit‚Äôs OAuth2 API at:

```bash
https://oauth.reddit.com/r/memes/top?t=day&limit=20
```

This requires:

- Client ID + Client Secret from a Reddit ‚ÄúScript App‚Äù

- Username + Password (for server-side password grant)

- A proper User-Agent string (Reddit requires this)

e.g.:

```bash
MemeCrawler/1.0 (by u:Ademi47)
```

üì• Example JSON Response (trimmed)

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "children": [
      {
        "data": {
          "id": "abc123",
          "title": "Did you know my Internet name is Ademi47",
          "url": "https://i.redd.it/ademi.png",
          "ups": 6743,
          "created_utc": 1725021123,
          "permalink": "/r/memes/comments/abc123/Did_you_know_my_Internet_name_is_Ademi47/"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

üóÑÔ∏è What I Store

**From each Reddit post, I extract and persist:**

- id ‚Üí stable Reddit post ID (used as unique key in DB)

- title ‚Üí post title

- url ‚Üí direct media or link

- ups ‚Üí upvote count

- created_utc ‚Üí original Reddit timestamp

- permalink ‚Üí Reddit link to the post

**This data is written into:**

- memes ‚Üí canonical table (latest state of each post)

- memesnapshots ‚Üí time-stamped snapshot (who was top at each 10-minute run)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è MemeCrawler Service (Back end)

A lightweight background job _MemeCrawlWorker_ runs on a schedule (e.g., every 20 minutes) and performs these steps:

- Fetch Top Posts (24h window)

- Calls Reddit API for /r/memes top posts (t=day, limit=20).

- Normalizes each record (title, media URL, upvotes, created_utc, author, permalink, etc.).

- De-duplication & Idempotency

- Computes a stable external key per post (e.g., reddit_post_id from Reddit‚Äôs id).

- Checks if that reddit_post_id already exists then insert snapshot accordingly.

- New post ‚Üí insert.

- Existing post ‚Üí upsert only fields that can change (e.g., upvotes, thumbnail, removed flag).

## üíª Front End Guide

### üé® UI Tech Stack & Features

The frontend is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to provide a clean, responsive, and interactive user interface for exploring and managing meme reports.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

#### **Framework: Next.js (React)**

- Provides **server-side rendering (SSR)** and **static site generation (SSG)** for fast loads.
- Simplifies **API integration** via `fetch` in client/server components.
- Supports environment variables (e.g. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`) to easily switch between **local** and **production APIs**.

#### **Styling: Tailwind CSS**

- Utility-first CSS framework for **fast styling**.
- Consistent, responsive layouts without writing custom CSS.
- Easy to apply hover/active states for buttons and interactive components.

#### **HTTP Requests: Axios / fetch**

- Used to call backend APIs (`/reports/top-24h` and `/reports/send-telegram-now`).
- Error handling and loading states included for better UX.

### **UI Components**

- Built with **React functional components**.
- Structured into reusable components: _ReportCard_, _ReportsPage_, _SendReportButton_.

---

### üåü Features

#### 1. **Memes Page**

- Displays the **Top 20 Memes (24h)** retrieved from the backend API.
- Each report card shows:
  - Meme **title**
  - Meme **upvotes** count
  - **Image preview** (from Reddit post URL)
- Responsive grid layout for desktop and mobile.

---

#### 2. **Send Report Button**

- A **call-to-action button** triggers the backend API `/reports/send-telegram-now`.
- When clicked, the system generates the **PDF report** and delivers it to Telegram.
- Button styled with Tailwind for **active/hover states** (blue ‚Üí lighter on hover).

---

#### 3. **CORS & API Integration**

- Configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` in `.env` to point to backend API.
- Added backend **CORS policy** (`AllowAnyOrigin`, `AllowAnyHeader`, `AllowAnyMethod`) to allow frontend requests.
- Ensures smooth communication between frontend and backend in dev and prod.

---

#### 4. **Error Handling & Debugging**

- UI gracefully handles:
  - **Empty data** (e.g., if API fails).
  - **CORS errors** ‚Üí logs helpful messages in the console.
  - **API errors** ‚Üí displays fallback states.

---

#### 5. **Deployment-Ready**

- Supports **local dev** (`npm run dev`) with `.env.local`.
- Easy deployment to **Vercel** or **AWS Amplify**.
- Uses environment variables for production-ready configuration.

---

### üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add **search and filter** (e.g., search by keyword in meme titles).
- Add **sorting controls** (sort by upvotes, createdAt).
- Paginate historical reports pulled from `memesnapshots` table.
- Dark/light mode toggle with Tailwind‚Äôs theme support.

---

üëâ In short, the **UI** provides a simple but powerful way to:

- Browse **top memes from Reddit**.
- Trigger automated **report generation**.
- Seamlessly integrate with the backend and n8n workflows.

---

## üìî GEN AI Prompts and Usage

Below are some of the key GEN-AI prompts that I used in this project.

**1. Frontend with Next.js + Tailwind + Troubleshooting**

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building a frontend with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Show me how to structure a Reports page that fetches from my API and displays data in cards. Include a Send Report button that calls a POST endpoint. Make it responsive.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a CORS error in my Next.js frontend when calling my backend API. Explain why this happens and how to fix it (server-side CORS policy vs client-side fetch).‚Äù

- ‚ÄúMy Tailwind buttons look greyed out. Show me how to style them with hover, active, and focus states so they look clickable.‚Äù

**2. Reddit API & Auth Token Retrieval**

- ‚ÄúExplain step-by-step how to create a Reddit script app, get a client ID and secret, and use them to generate an OAuth2 access token with the password grant type. Show example curl commands.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhy am I getting invalid_grant when requesting a Reddit access token? Walk me through the common causes and fixes.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow can I safely store Reddit API credentials (client id, secret, username, password) in environment variables for my .NET backend?‚Äù

**3. LINQ Queries & Code Optimization**

- "I have a list of memes with fields (Title, Upvotes, CreatedAt). Show me a LINQ query in C# to get the top 20 memes from the last 24 hours ordered by Upvotes.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúExplain how to optimize EF Core LINQ queries so they don‚Äôt fetch unnecessary data. Show examples of Select, AsNoTracking, and filtering before projecting.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to profile slow LINQ queries in .NET and rewrite them for performance?‚Äù

**4. Why I Picked n8n for Automation**

- ‚ÄúI want to automatically fetch data from my API every hour, generate a PDF, and send it to Telegram. What workflow automation tool should I use? Compare Zapier, Airflow, and n8n.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúShow me how to build an n8n workflow with Cron ‚Üí HTTP Request ‚Üí HTML to PDF ‚Üí Telegram Bot. Include JSON structure for the workflow.‚Äù

- ‚ÄúHow can I test my local API with a remote n8n instance? Explain tunneling options (ngrok, localtunnel) and how to configure n8n HTTP nodes.‚Äù

---

## üîç Production Deployment

### üöÄ Frontend: Production Deployment with AWS Amplify (Next.js + Tailwind)

This section describes how the **UI** is deployed to **AWS Amplify Hosting** using a connected GitHub repo. It supports both **SPA** and **Next.js (SSR/CSR)** builds.

---

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- GitHub repo with our frontend (Next.js)
- Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://memecrawler.duckdns.org`
- Backend already reachable over HTTPS (for CORS)

---

#### 1) Connect Repository

1. Open **AWS Amplify ‚Üí Host a web app ‚Üí GitHub**.
2. Select the repo/branch (e.g., `main`).
3. Framework auto-detected as **Next.js**.

---

#### 2) Build Settings

Amplify usually generates this automatically:

```yaml
# amplify.yml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: .next
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

#### 3) Environment Variables

**_In Amplify ‚Üí App settings ‚Üí Environment variables, I added:_**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE = https://memecrawler.duckdns.org`

- Note: Avoid server-side fetches at build time for external APIs (can cause fetch failed / ENOTFOUND). Use client-side fetch or runtime SSR with try/catch.

#### 4. Custom Domain & HTTPS

- 1. Amplify ‚Üí Domain management ‚Üí Add domain. --> This is optional. I left this blank as I don't have an extra domain registered.

- 2. Select branch mapping ‚Üí Amplify provisions ACM cert + Route 53 records automatically.

- 3. Wait for propagation; test website.

#### 5. CORS Considerations

- Backend must allow our UI origin: `https://main.duj0n3y16kfpp.amplifyapp.com/`

- CORS policy (server): allow GET, POST, necessary headers, credentials.

#### 6. Troubleshooting (WIP)

- CORS errors: Verify API‚Äôs allowed origins and HTTPS (mismatched protocols cause mixed content).

- Next.js build fails (fetch): Move external fetch to client-side or a server route that runs at request-time.

- 404 on deep links (SPA): Enable rewrites to index.html.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Backend: Production Deployment on AWS EC2 (Docker Compose + NGINX + TLS)

This section explains deploying the .NET 8 API on EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023) behind NGINX with Let‚Äôs Encrypt TLS. It pairs with the Amplify-hosted UI.

‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Domain/DNS control (Route 53 or registrar)

- Repo containing src/Memes.Api and /deploy/docker-compose.yml

- Environment file for API (src/Memes.Api/.env):

```bash
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:8080
Telegram__BotToken=...
Telegram__ChatId=...
Reddit__UserAgent=MemeCrawler/1.0 (by u:Ademi47)
Reddit__ClientId=...
Reddit__ClientSecret=...
Reddit__Username=...
Reddit__Password=...
```

- Security Group allowing 80/443 (and temporary 8080/5678 if needed for testing)

#### 1) Launch EC2

AMI: Amazon Linux 2023

Instance: t3.small or above

Assign Elastic IP (optional)

SSH into instance as ec2-user

#### 2) Install Docker & Compose Plugin

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install -y docker docker-compose-plugin git
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
```

#### 3) Clone & Run Stack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ademi47/MemeCrawler.git
cd <repo>/deploy
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose ps
```

Typical `docker-compose.yml` includes:

- api (builds from src/Memes.Api)

- postgres

#### 4) NGINX Reverse Proxy

```bash
sudo dnf install -y nginx
sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
```

Create `/etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf`:

```bash
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name memecrawler.duckdns.org;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  }
}
```

Test & reload:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Point DNS: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org ‚Üí <EC2 My public IP>

#### 5) TLS (Used Let‚Äôs Encrypt via Certbot)

```bash
sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d https://memecrawler.duckdns.org
```

auto-renew is installed by default; verify with:

```bash
systemctl status certbot-renew.timer
```

#### 6) Harden CORS for Production

In API CORS policy, whitelist only our UI origin:

Allow methods/headers actually used:

GET, POST

Content-Type, Authorization (if needed)

#### 7) Optional: Systemd for Auto-Start

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/memes.service <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Meme Stack
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
WorkingDirectory=/home/ec2-user/<repo>/deploy
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker compose up -d
ExecStop=/usr/bin/docker compose down
RemainAfterExit=yes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
sudo systemctl enable memes && sudo systemctl start memes
```

#### 8) Logs & Monitoring

```bash
docker compose logs -f api
journalctl -u nginx -f
```

#### Summary

- Frontend: AWS Amplify ‚Üí fast CI/CD, custom domain, HTTPS, env vars.

- Backend: EC2 + Docker Compose ‚Üí NGINX reverse proxy ‚Üí TLS via Certbot.

- Integration: CORS locked to UI domain, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE points to HTTPS API.

## üîç Live Demo

### Video Guide

Please Click below link to watch the project Demo.

```bash
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upHuJ_AFY1s
```

**Note:**

```bash
This video is unlisted hence it's not searchable. Kindly do not share the link.
The project has been successfully deployed to the production environment for functionality testing.
However, I encountered some CORS issues on the frontend, which are preventing it from running fully at the moment.
I‚Äôm actively working on resolving these and will have the frontend up and running as soon as possible.
```

### Production Test using API calls via Browser (or Postman)

**Memes Route**

```bash
1. Open: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/memes/top-24h, Alteratively you may go to -> https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/swagger/index.html. then trigger the API via swagger.

Note: You‚Äôll see a JSON array of meme posts.

Sample:

{
"id":"1n3fwwb",
"title":"Monster.com",
"author":"Own_Touch9354",
"permalink":"https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/1n3fwwb/monstercom/",
"contentUrl":"https://i.redd.it/wuaox6tb90mf1.jpeg",
"upvotes":19788,"numComments":72,
"createdUtc":"2025-08-29T18:53:35+00:00",
"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/13uoRnFJFR9ASqdkVBIX67PpI4ycBv8-t_HB3tcpyEg.jpg"
}

3. In the UI, when /memes route refreshes, this calls the above API and shows the Memes posts list (with images, vote counts and post links).

4. There are two views in the UI. /memes and /reports
```

**Reports Route**

```bash
1. Open: https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/reports/top-24h, Alteratively you may go to -> https://memecrawler.duckdns.org/swagger/index.html. then trigger the API via swagger.

2. Click Send Report on the Reports page.

3. The UI fires: POST /reports/send-telegram-now.

4. The API fetches current top-24h posts and formats a summary (or builds PDF).

5. Telegram Bot sends the message/document into our configured chat.

6. You see a success toast in the UI (and the new report in PDF format in Telegram).
```
